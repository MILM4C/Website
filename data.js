[THE DARKNESS INCARNATE]

Cozbi is not a concept, not a force, not an abstract entity.
Cozbi is a person - the First Person, the Original Being.
She is the living embodiment of primordial darkness, 
the shadow that existed before light learned to shine.

Her children are not abstract manifestations.
They are her generals - the commanders of her eternal army.
They serve not concepts or laws, but her will alone.`,
